  <!--
  This file defines a base format for use by all the schema files of this format.

  Most real DFDL schemas will expand past a single file just to make editing
  easier and organize the parts of the schema. So it is easiest to start off
  right away with a separate file for the base format.

        <!--
        Place the basic DFDL properties shared by the format below.

        This makes it easy to share them as your format grows into
        multiple files of DFDL.

        Note on syntax: DFDL properties placed inside a dfdl:format
        element do not (and cannot have) a "dfdl:" prefix.

        Some properties may be the same as in the GeneralFormat.
        If they are important properties for the format it is
        best to list them here anyway. The fallback to GeneralFormat is
        really to avoid having to mention properties that aren't
        relevant to the format, but which Daffodil requires anyway.
